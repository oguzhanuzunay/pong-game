Extras
- The game is Completely Pure Javascript.
- Even if the game is exited in the middle of the game, the score is kept in the local storage and when the same page is opened again, the game continues from where it left off.
- 3 Pieces Sounds are added to the game. (Score, Hit, WallHit)
- Ball acceleration has been added for each impact to make it harder as the game progresses.
- As the game gets faster and the ball is hit 5 times in total, the ball comes out of the back.
- 2 artificial intelligence (Bot Kevin and Bot Connor) that can play the game by themselves have been added. (O key of the keyboard activates the bot on the left, P key activates the bot on the right.)
- Bots can be activated or deactivated while playing the game. This way, you can take breaks even while playing the game :).
